# Java-Instant-Messenger
Java Instant Messenger is currently a Work In Progress messaging application, which incorporates Swing to create the GUI. 
For now, only two users can message each other using the app, but I hope to make this multi-client-friendly 
in the not-so-distant-future.

## Plans For January 2018
### A Multi-Threaded, Multi-Client Application
For now, the messenger only works between two users, ie: a server and client relationship. However, I am aiming to make this
messenger multi-threaded, so that multiple clients can talk at once, and the server will update each of the clients' chat 
messages one by one. 

### Futuristic UI
I am also aiming to give the messenger a futuristic UI with a dark theme, and I hope to migrate to JavaFX also.
